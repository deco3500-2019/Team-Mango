# Team-Mango
We are team mango, our project is a platform dedicated to satisfying volunteers to find suitable activities and organizers to find their own volunteers. We believe that every volunteer has its own shining place, and every activity has to participate. People who come in. We are committed to better matching the two, providing a better experience and greater efficiency for volunteer activities.

**How to set-up**

The high-fidelity prototype of this project is a pure front-end simulation website. The database and server functions required by the back-end use JavaScript and Local storage function to simulate to achieve a sufficient high-fidelity functional experience for user testing. Therefore, the setup is relatively simple. Following next steps.

1. Download the project from https://github.com/deco3500-2019/Team-Mango

2. Open Team-Mango-Master folder and click index.html and prototype will start to run in browser.

3. Because this is a local version of prototype, we skipped making log-in pages. So, users need to play two different roles in volunteer page and organiser page. Click the top-right button “Switch” can switch between two versions.

4. The signed volunteers and events are created automatically when first initialised using data from js/eventData.js and store into local storage. Users may change the preset event and volunteer information by changing the object in js/eventData.js Users can reset the project by deleting the local storage data.

# Design process overview
Our design process was divided into 8 steps including background research, user research, ideation, design low-fidelity prototype, user evaluation based on the low-fidelity prototype, design high-fidelity prototype, user evaluation based on high-fidelity prototype, further improvements (see Fig 1).

Fig 1. The design process

## 1. Background research

In order to have a better understanding of our domain: Community group coordination – volunteer recruitment, our team did a detailed literature review for domain space.

The previous research provided us a basic understanding of what is volunteering, how these voluntary activities work, where are these activities held and why people participate in these activities. And the problem space was found.
For volunteers, a lack of precise and clear understanding of the voluntary activity background information brings negative impact to them due to the various types of information like organized date, location, topics and so on.

For volunteering organizations, it is difficult for them to find the most suitable volunteers since skill sets of a specific volunteer don’t meet their needs, which results in a mismatch between volunteers and volunteering organizations and costs both of them much time as well as energy.

Later, by exploring the existing applications in this domain, our team finds these solutions have poor information visualisation, lacking participating confirmation, social features, the participation of volunteers. In addition, there was no expression of volunteer interest and willingness, and there was little interaction between volunteers and organizations.

## 2. User research

In this stage, our team did a contextual inquiry with target users including both volunteers and volunteering organizations. We invited and two volunteering organizers and four people with volunteering experience before. By having an interview with them and analysing their opinions which focused on understanding their behaviours, needs, pain points, we were able to explore proposed solutions and features based on user’s needs.

* Interview questions for organizations

* Interview questions for volunteers

## 3. Ideation

After gathering users’ data from the user research stage, ideas were generated in our design team by discussing ideas and drawing sketches on the iPad (see Fig2). In our project, target users were divided into two groups: organizations and volunteers. Correspondingly, organizer mode and volunteer mode were provided.

In organizer mode, key functions including:

* Matching and managing suitable volunteers;

* Publishing and managing volunteer events.

In volunteer mode, core features contained:

* Finding and signing up more various events of different organisations;

* Getting a clearer understanding of events information.

## 4. Low-fidelity Prototype

Based on our discussion and sketch, we designed a digital low-fidelity prototype by InVison and Adobe XD and implemented some basic functions by web development. This version prototype focused on three main features in each user mode (see Fig 3).

In organizer mode, event form, selecting candidates form and candidates’ profile form were made. For volunteer mode, events list view, event map view and confirm process were designed.

## 5. User Evaluation based on low-fidelity prototype

After created our low-fidelity prototype, we gathered feedback from organizers and volunteers by using Think Aloud and post-interview method. New requirements of our product were identified:

* Giving users more autonomy;
* Designing more intuitive and easy-to-use content;
* Providing users with more personalized functions

## 6. High-fidelity Prototype

In this phase, our team created a high-fidelity prototype according to evaluation outcomes from low-fidelity to refine prototype towards the final outcome. This high-fidelity prototype presented as a website, which is our final product type: a web mobile application. In this version, we improved our user interface and interaction flow. Additionally, we changed our visual form in organizer mode to a clearer list because some testers thought it was hard to understand. Besides, we also added timetable function to help users to arrange their schedule.

## 7. User Evaluation based on high-fidelity prototype

In the evaluation of our high-fidelity prototype, we prepared tasks and then made interviews with participants. All the participants tested as an organizer then played as a volunteer.
In organizer mode, prepared tasks including “Create new event”, “Event overview” and “Volunteer visualization”.
In the volunteer mode, the tasks are mainly about three pages “Home”, “Event” and “Profile”.
 
## 8. Further Improvement

For later iteration, we would like to improve our user interface like designing clearer layouts, interaction methods such as change both the date and time selection into dropdown form, hover hints for certain functionalities as well as providing more details in the event description page. Furthermore, a map which can display locations of events is needed to provide an intuitive overview of locations for users. Besides, mutual evaluation system between organizations and volunteers is also in our consideration for further improvement since this kind of system can help both sides understand each other better and this system can serve as a supervisor as well.
