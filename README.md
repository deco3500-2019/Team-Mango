# Team-Mango
We are team mango, our project is a platform dedicated to satisfying volunteers to find suitable activities and organizers to find their own volunteers. We believe that every volunteer has its own shining place, and every activity has to participate. People who come in. We are committed to better matching the two, providing a better experience and greater efficiency for volunteer activities.

**How to set-up**

The high-fidelity prototype of this project is a pure front-end simulation website. The database and server functions required by the back-end use JavaScript and Local storage function to simulate to achieve a sufficient high-fidelity functional experience for user testing. Therefore, the setup is relatively simple. Following next steps.

1. Download the project from https://github.com/deco3500-2019/Team-Mango

2. Open Team-Mango-Master folder and click index.html and prototype will start to run in browser.

3. Because this is a local version of prototype, we skipped making log-in pages. So, users need to play two different roles in volunteer page and organiser page. Click the top-right button “Switch” can switch between two versions.

4. The signed volunteers and events are created automatically when first initialised using data from js/eventData.js and store into local storage. Users may change the preset event and volunteer information by changing the object in js/eventData.js Users can reset the project by deleting the local storage data.
